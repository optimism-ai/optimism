Optimism helps user identify what aspects of their life are contributing to their daily moods. Aspects of a user's life includes their:

1. Work life
2. Learning life
3. Health life
4. Social life
5. Media life
6. Mental life

A person's **mood** in theses **aspects** of life are often either positively or negatively influenced by a **feeling** towards a certain **factor**. For instance, a person's work life will be negatively influenced by a bad customer experience. In that example, the aspect is the person's work life and the factor is the customer experience.

A factor is typically tied to a mood, such as happy or sad. In the example above, the customer experience is tied to a sad feeling.

Optimism leverages these four core components (moods, aspects, feelings, factors) in order to provide users with the ability to easily track their moods. Users will provide a factor and a feeling. The Optimism Engine will then utilize that data to then adjust a mood score towards specific life aspect.
